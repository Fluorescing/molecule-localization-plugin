# About #
The M<sup>2</sup>LE molecule localization plug-in for ImageJ searches a stack of images for molecules and locates their positions.  It was written during the summer of 2011 at the California State Polytechnic University, Pomona as part of undergraduate research into super-resolution microscopy.  See [here for news and release notes](Updates.md).
